Google Keep style app made using React

<h2>To Run the App</h2>
-Clone this repo.<br>
-Go to this directory using your terminal.<br>
-run "npm install" to install dependencies<br>
-run "npm start"<br>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a Google Keep clone application created with React that allows users to take notes. I will create a back-end and user authentication in the upcoming days!

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
This app was so fun to create and allowed me to improve my knowledge on React components, props, state, JSX, animation packages and many others.
The app is simple and straightforward. Once you load it click on the textbox that says "Title" and the entire note-taking box will open up with a nice animation.
Then simply add or delete your notes using the relevant buttons.

Feel free to reach out to me for future functionalities. I aim to improve the design and styling in the upcoming days!
